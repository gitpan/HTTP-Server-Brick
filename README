HTTP-Server-Brick version 0.1.4

$Id$

HTTP::Server::Brick allows you to quickly wrap a prototype web server around some
Perl code. The underlying server daemon is HTTP::Daemon and the performance should
be fine for demo's, light internal systems, etc.

See the POD documentation in the module for more information.

INSTALLATION

To install with Module::Build, you can use the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

Alternatively, run the following commands (Module::Build is still
required, this is just a wrapper):

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install


DEPENDENCIES

    LWP
    Test::More
    version

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

It's version 0.1.4 - there's bound to be some bugs!

The tests fail on windows due to forking limitations. I don't see any
reason why the server itself won't work but I haven't tried it
personally, and I have to figure out a way to test it from a test
script that will work on Windows.

In forking mode there is no attempt to limit the number of forked
children - beware of forking yourself ;)

No attention has been given to propagating any exception text into the
http error (although the exception/die message will appear in the
error_log).

Versions 1.02 and earlier of HTTP::Daemon::SSL has a
feature/documentation conflict where it will never timeout. This means
your server won't respond to a HUP signal until the next request is
served. Version 1.03_01 (developer release) and later do not have this
issue.

Latest versions are always available from CPAN. Development versions
are available from my CVS repository:
